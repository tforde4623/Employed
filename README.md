### Difficulties - I encountered some challenges, like with all projects, as that's how you learn. The first challenges was having to think about how I would program the flow of the CLI. The first method I found seemed messy to me, being lines of if statements. So I challenged that, and created a much cleaner code, furthering my skills in promises I made it work with individualized code blocks, calling eachother asyncronously, once the questions and tasks they needed to do were accomplished.
